## üìù Overview

This project is a comprehensive banking transaction application built on a microservices architecture. It allows users to manage accounts, perform transactions, and monitor their financial activities through a sleek, modern interface.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application consists of the following microservices:

- **User Service** - Manages user registration, authentication, and profile data
- **Account Service** - Handles account creation, balance management, and transactions
- **Logs Service** - Records all system activities for audit and debugging
- **Mailing Service** - Manages email notifications for important account activities

Each microservice is designed to operate independently, with its own database and business logic.

---

## üìå Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| MongoDB | 4.4+ | NoSQL database for user data and logs |
| PostgreSQL | 12+ | Relational database for transaction records |
| Node.js | 16+ | JavaScript runtime environment |
| npm | 7+ | Node.js package manager |
| Git | Any | Version control system |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Errors**
   - Ensure MongoDB and PostgreSQL are running
   - Verify connection strings in each microservice's `.env` file

2. **Dependency Issues**

```bash
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

3. **Port Conflicts**
   - Check if specified ports are already in use
   - Update ports in the configuration files if needed

4. **Microservices Communication**
   - Ensure all microservices are running
   - Check network configuration if services are on different machines
